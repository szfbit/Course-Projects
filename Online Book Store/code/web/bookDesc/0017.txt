Dark Souls is back and it's darker and more difficult than ever. This time death is certain. Every minute. The Dark Souls II Collector's Edition Guide is here to light a path through the darkness and to help free players from their wicked curse.
From the same team that created the critically acclaimed Dark Souls guide comes the most anticipated strategy guide for the most unforgiving game of the year.
This chapter uses beautiful, detailed maps to guide you in exploring every inch of the game's huge world. It will take you through each area point-by-point, preparing you for ambushes, revealing NPCs and shortcuts, and highlighting every last item along the way.
