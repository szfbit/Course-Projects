Critiqued takes you on a journey with designer Christina Beard through an iterative design experiment. With her poster in tow, she meets with leading designers, writers, and curators. At each stop, the participant critiques the poster and talks about his or her own design process. Based on their conversation, Christina redesigns the poster before heading to the next critique — a process similar to the children’s game telephone.
This book is not about learning new software or being told how to do something — it’s about exploring and discovering an approach to design that works for you.
The experiment is presented as part memoir and part interview and gives readers insight into each designer’s process and personality. Each chapter features a design prompt for readers to explore 23 distinct approaches in design and to compare multiple perspectives.
