Walt Disney Animation Studios presents an epic tale of adventure and comedy with Frozen. When a prophecy traps a kingdom in eternal winter, Anna, a young dreamer, must team up with Kristoff, a daring mountain man, and his reindeer on the grandest of journeys to find Anna's sister, the Snow Queen Elsa, and put an end to her icy spell. Encountering mystical trolls, a hilarious snowman named Olaf, Everest-like extremes, and magic at every turn, Anna and Kristoff battle the elements in a race to save the kingdom from destruction. Directed by Chris Buck (Tarzan) and produced by Peter Del Vecho (Winnie the Pooh,The Princess and the Frog), the comedy-adventure Frozen journeys into theaters in November 2013. This Step 2 Step into Reading leveled reader brings all the magic and adventure of Frozen to girls and boys ages 4-6 who are just learning to read on their own.
