Say your worst nightmare came true and you not only missed a class in your design foundation course on color theory–one of the first required courses for that coveted design degree–but you missed the ENTIRE SEMESTER? What would you do? Here’s what: You’d go to the funniest, smartest, most creative kid in class and borrow his or her notebook. And that notebook would look exactly like Design Fundamentals: Notes on Color Theory.
Design Fundamentals: Notes on Color Theory looks and functions like a student’s sketchbook with hand-written notes and illustrations capturing the key concepts and assignments taught in a basic course on color. First in a series, Design Fundamentals: Notes on Color Theory is an essential guide and learning experience covering the basics and history of color science, the practical awareness of color qualities and characteristics, and the use of color in art and design for composition and visual expression. Fun and fast-paced, this imaginative notebook isn’t required reading, it’s desired reading; and it’s one book that students will want to keep and enjoy long after they’ve mastered the fundamentals of designing with color.
