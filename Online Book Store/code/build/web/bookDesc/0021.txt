Satisfy your sweet tooth instantly with a microwave cake baked in a mug.
Mug Cakes contains one hundred quick and easy recipes that are ready in a matter of minutes! Why reach for store-bought mix that takes up to an hour to bake? Let Mug Cakes show you how to make a quick, tiny batter to mix in a mug with a fork! They are the perfect personal serving size when you don't feel like baking an entire cake or pan of cupcakes.
With dozens of mouthwatering recipes, there is something to please every taste. It's all here, from basic Buttermilk Cake, Red Velvet, and Carrot Cake to fancy Chocolate Caramel Fleur de Sel. Let the kids try their hand at S'mores and Root Beer Float cakes. Then send them to bed and try the liquor-infused recipes from the Adults Only chapter (Irish Coffee Cake, anyone?). There are recipes for cake lovers with special dietary needs, and even noncake recipes like mug puddings, pies, and cheesecakes, when you get tired of cake (yes...it can happen!).
