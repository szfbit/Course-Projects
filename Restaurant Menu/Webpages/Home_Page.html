		<h3>Bouillabaisse</h3>

		<p><span class="firstLetter">B</span>ouillabaisse is a traditional Provençal
		fish stew originating from the port city of Marseille. The French and English
		form bouillabaisse comes from the Provençal Occitan word bolhabaissa, a
		compound that consists of the two verbs bolhir (to boil) and abaissar (to
		reduce heat, i.e., simmer). There are at least three kinds of fish in a
		traditional bouillabaisse, typically scorpionfish sea robin and European conger
		and it can also include gilt-head bream turbot, monkfish, mullet, or silver
		hake.It also usually includes shellfish and other seafood such as sea urchins,
		mussels, velvet crabs, spider crab or octopus. </p>

		<p>Vegetables such as leeks, onions, tomatoes, celery and potatoes are simmered
		together with the broth and served with the fish. The broth is traditionally
		served with a rouille, a mayonnaise made of olive oil, garlic, saffron and
		cayenne pepper on grilled slices of bread. </p>

		<h3>Blanquette de veau</h3>

		<p><span class="firstLetter">B</span>lanquette de veau is a French veal ragout
		in which neither the veal nor the butter is browned in the cooking process. To
		refrain from browning meat and fat in this way, is to cook them en blanquette.
		From Larousse Gastronomique "BLANQUETTE: the french term for a ragout of white
		meat (veal, lamb or poultry)cooked in a white stock or water with aromatic
		flavorings. </p>

		<p>Theoretically, the sauce is obtained by making a roux amd adding cream and
		egg yolks. However, the roux is more often than not omitted. Blanquette had a
		very important place in historical cuisine and became a classic of bourgeois
		cookery. Blanquettes are also made with fish (monkfish) and vegetables (chard
		and celery.)" </p>

		<h3>Steak frites</h3>

		<p><span class="firstLetter">S</span>teak fries is an American term for a
		particular type of French fries, usually more-or-less analogous to what the
		British call chips. As there are many different types of preparations for
		French fries, the terms used to describe them vary from country to country and
		region to region. Steak fries usually, however, refer to thickly cut wedges of
		potatoes prepared in the same way as normal French fries. </p>

		<p>The actual origin of French fries is a matter of some debate, with different
		countries claiming responsibility for their origin. The Belgians hold that they
		were the progenitors of French fries, as far back as the 1680s, where potatoes
		were held to be fried as a substitute for small fried fish during the coldest
		winter months. Others hold that Spain was the first country to dine on fried
		strips of potatoes, mostly pointing to the fact that Spain was the first
		European country to have the potato introduced from the New World. </p>

	<h3>Valençay (cheese)</h3>

		<p><span class="firstLetter">V</span>alençay is a cheese made in the province
		of Berry in central France. Its name is derived from the town of Valençay in
		the Indre department. Distinctive in its truncated pyramidal shape, Valençay
		is an unpasteurised goats-milk cheese weighing 200-250g and around 7cm in
		height. Its rustic blue-grey colour is made by the natural moulds that form its
		rind, darkened with a dusting of charcoal. The young cheese has a fresh, citric
		taste, with age giving it a nutty taste characteristic of goats cheeses. The
		cheese achieved AOC status in 1998 making Valençay the first region to achieve
		AOC status for both its cheese and its wine. </p>

		<p>Foie gras is a popular and well-known delicacy in French cuisine. Its flavor
		is described as rich, buttery, and delicate, unlike that of an ordinary duck or
		goose liver. Foie gras is sold whole, or is prepared into mousse, parfait, or
		pâté (the lowest quality), and may also be served as an accompaniment to
		another food item, such as steak. French law states that "Foie gras belongs to
		the protected cultural and gastronomical heritage of France." </p>
